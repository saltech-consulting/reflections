Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: It creates a git repo. It's needed for tracking the changes. :-)

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: It decouples the files your currently working on from all the files in the repo.
